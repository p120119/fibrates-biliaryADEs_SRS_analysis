# 30_stratified.md â€” Subgroup (sex, age band, BMI band) analysis

## Cleaning subgroup columns (JADER example)

```sql
CREATE VIEW jader_subgroup_base AS
SELECT
  p.primary_id,
  p.bmi,
  p.age_num,
  p.sex
FROM jader_plid p
WHERE

 -- no label normalization; drop error values only
  p.bmi IS NOT NULL
  AND p.age_num IS NOT NULL
  AND p.sex IS NOT NULL
  AND UPPER(TRIM(p.sex)) NOT IN ('NA','N/A','ERROR');
```

> No label normalization. Exclude NULL/NA/ERROR values for subgroup variables.

## Define groupers

```sql
CREATE VIEW jader_subgroups AS
SELECT
  primary_id,
  sex AS sex_group,
  CASE WHEN age_num BETWEEN 20 AND 59 THEN '20-50s'
       WHEN age_num >= 60 THEN '60s+'
       ELSE NULL END AS age_group,
  CASE WHEN bmi < 25 THEN '<25'
       WHEN bmi >= 25 THEN '>=25'
       ELSE NULL END AS bmi_group
FROM jader_subgroup_base;
```

Create analogous `faers_subgroups` with FAERS-specific fields.

## 2x2 per subgroup

Repeat the extraction in **20_disproportionality.md** but join through the subgroup view and group by `(drug_of_interest, subgroup_name, subgroup_level)`.

Skeleton:

```sql
CREATE VIEW {ds}_twobytwo_subgroup AS
SELECT
  g.sex_group AS subgroup_level, 'sex' AS subgroup_name,
  t.drug_of_interest, SUM(...) AS n11, SUM(...) AS n12, SUM(...) AS n21, SUM(...) AS n22
FROM {ds}_twobytwo_inputs t
JOIN {ds}_subgroups g USING (primary_id)
GROUP BY 1,2,3
UNION ALL
SELECT
  g.age_group, 'age', ...
UNION ALL
SELECT
  g.bmi_group, 'bmi', ...
;
```

Compute metrics with the same formulas per `(drug_of_interest, subgroup_name, subgroup_level)` and export to CSV as needed.
